# NewStickOS 3.0
I have learned enough mistakes (hopefully), and decided to rewrite again.

Just a student learning

# NewStickOS 3.0 (2019)
New year modification, nothing has been tested, just compiled

# NewStickOS 3.0 (March 2019)
After about 3 months, I feel I have made some good (slow, and unimportant) progress.

# NewStickOS 3.0 (April 2019)
Decided to use acpica. Remodeled my make system. OS compiles on new compiler (i686-nos)
