# NewStickOS
Remaking kernel of StickOS (old project of mine, can find it on github too).
Didn't like how stuffy I was, kept on changing this and that and I could feel claustrophobic.
New kernel is being made now.
Changes are going to be made to bootloader and boot2.

Soon to come in boot2:
  Getting memory map.
  Better determining if a20 is enabled.
  
Soon to come in bootloader:
  Clean up some of the useless code.
